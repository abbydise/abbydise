Hello, I am Abby Dise. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Drexel University. I am looking for 6 month co-ops for the next two years between April - September. I have the most experience in Python, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am willing and capable to learn whatever I need to, however. Check out my website at abbydise.com for more information of my background!
